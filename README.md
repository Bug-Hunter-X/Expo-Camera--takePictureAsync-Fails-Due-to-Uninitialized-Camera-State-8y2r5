# Expo Camera: takePictureAsync Fails Due to Uninitialized Camera State

This repository demonstrates a common but often subtle error when using the Expo Camera API. The `takePictureAsync` method is called before the camera is fully initialized, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Problem

The `takePictureAsync` method of Expo's Camera API might fail if called before the camera is ready.  The preview might display correctly, but the underlying camera state might not be fully initialized, leading to errors.

## Solution

Ensure the camera is ready before using `takePictureAsync`. This can be achieved by checking the `isAvailable` property or using an asynchronous `onCameraReady` function to coordinate your photo taking with the camera initialization.

## How to Reproduce (bug.js)

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where `takePictureAsync` is called immediately without checking the camera's ready state.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code, efficiently handling the camera's initialization and taking pictures once it is ready.
